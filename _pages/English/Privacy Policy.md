  **Here's how you can tailor the explanation for the location usage in your
  privacy policy to reflect its specific purpose:**


  ### Location Usage for the App


  Our app utilizes location services to provide parents with real-time updates
  on the location of their children when they are on the bus traveling to and
  from kindergarten. This feature ensures parents have peace of mind and can
  track their child’s transit for added safety.


  ### Details of Location Usage:


  **Purpose**: The app uses the location data of the child’s device (or a
  designated tracking device) to show real-time updates on their journey.


  **Functionality**: Location data is used solely for tracking purposes while
  the child is in transit and is visible only to authorized parents or
  guardians.


  **Safety Assurance**: This feature helps parents stay informed and ensures
  that children reach their destination safely.


  ### Privacy Policy Explanation


  We take the privacy and security of your data very seriously. Here’s how we
  handle location information:


  **Information We Collect**: We collect real-time location data from the
  child’s device when the bus route begins and ends. This data is only active
  during transit times and is not continuously tracked outside of these periods.


  ##### How We Use Your Data:


  **Tracking**: To allow parents or guardians to monitor their child’s journey
  for safety purposes.


  **Notifications**: To send alerts or updates about the bus’s status and
  estimated arrival times.


  **Data Sharing**: The location data is shared exclusively with authorized
  users (e.g., parents or guardians) through secure in-app access. We do not
  share location data with third-party advertisers or external parties.
