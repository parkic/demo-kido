  description: >
    Simply put - When the adults surrounding a child are calm and connected, the
    child thrives.


    With Kido, every exchange is a step towards a better understanding, stronger
    relationships, and a more cohesive community. We believe that when
    conversations are seamless, transparent and centered around the child,
    everyone benefits.
